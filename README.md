# Atrial Fibrillation Detection From PPG
## 336018 - Machine Learning for Physiological Time Series Analysis

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent 
arrhythmia, resulting in varying and irregular heartbeats. AF 
increases risk for numerous cardiovascular diseases including 
stroke, heart failure and as a result, computer aided efficient 
monitoring of AF is crucial, especially for intensive care unit 
(ICU) patients.

A subset of the Medical Information Mart 
for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III database containing 35 subjects
is used in this study. We compare the AF detection performance 
of several classifiers for both the training and blinded test data. We present two feature sets which combine both local and global information (both morphological and heart rate variability features) and evaluate their predictive ability in the AF detection task.
